### Mission
The IGSIO was founded after lengthy discussions regarding the standardization of tracked ultrasound communication to work towards improving the interoperability between industrial products and research software platforms [[1]](http://wiki.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/2016_Winter_Project_Week/Projects/TrackedUltrasoundStandardization). Prior to these discussions, the commonly accepted solution was to pass specially constructed messages over the OpenIGTLink protocol. This workaround solution indicated that a more formal definition was needed to enable the research community to move towards a vision held by the founding members.

The mission of the IGSIO is to develop a written standard defining the communication of tracked ultrasound systems between software platforms and to produce an open-source reference implementation of an OpenIGTLink client and server for use by any adhering software platform.

### Goals
We seek to achieve the following goals:
* To advance the image-guided systems community through co-operation and collaboration
* To define a written standard for tracked ultrasound communication
* To provide a reference standard implementation of a tracked ultrasound client/server

### The Standard: Tracked Ultrasound over OpenIGTLink (TUO)
The standard is presented here as a draft. Extensions to the OpenIGTLink protocol have been proposed [[2]](http://openigtlink.org/protocols/v3_proposal.html) and implementation of these extensions is underway [[3]](https://github.com/IGSIO/OpenIGTLinkIF).
